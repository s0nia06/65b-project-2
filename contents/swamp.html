  <h1>The Green Mirror</h1>

  <p>Nobody ever wandered into the Greenthorn Swamp on purpose.</p>

  <p>It was the kind of place maps avoided, a smear of green tucked between forgotten roads and deeper silences. The locals said it was cursed. The old folks said it was sacred. The children dared each other to throw stones at the edge and run before the trees noticed.</p>

  <p>But Mara was neither child nor local. She came with a backpack, a notebook, and a question: <em>What does the world forget when no one is looking?</em></p>

  <p>The swamp welcomed her in total silence.</p>

  <p>Sunlight sifted through a canopy of crooked trees, dappling the water below in gold and shadow. The surface of the swamp was so perfectly still, it looked like glass—but it wasn’t. A carpet of green algae floated thick and soft, like the swamp had decided long ago to grow its own sky.</p>

  <p>She stepped carefully. Every sound—every breath, every crunch of leaf—felt like it echoed through the trees. The deeper she wandered, the quieter everything became.</p>

  <p>Until there was no sound at all.</p>

  <p>Then the green beneath her boots rippled.</p>

  <p>Something moved—not toward her, but <em>with</em> her. A presence. Not threatening, but aware. Watching.</p>

  <p>She stopped at a clearing where the water opened up like a mirror. Her reflection stared back at her—except it didn’t.</p>

  <p>It blinked.</p>

  <p>Her reflection blinked <em>first</em>.</p>

  <p>She dropped her notebook. The swamp held its breath. And then, in a whisper only moss could hear, the reflection spoke.</p>

  <p><em>“What are you willing to trade for an answer?”</em></p>
