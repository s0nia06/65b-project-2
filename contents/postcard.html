    <h1>The Postcard from the Sun</h1>

    <p>It arrived on a Tuesday.</p>

    <p>The kind of Tuesday that drifts by unnoticed—sky pale, air quiet, the world in low resolution. I was knee-deep in couch cushions, hunting for a missing Lego dragon head, when my mother called from the hallway, “You’ve got mail!”</p>

    <p>I wasn’t expecting anything. But then, there it was: a postcard, too bright for this gray day. The word <em>FLORIDA</em> stretched across the front in thick, shadowed letters, like it had leapt off a vintage billboard and into the present moment. The sun beamed in the corner—round and orange, smiling with squinted eyes and lines like sunrays drawn by a child who knows joy.</p>

    <p>Beneath it, a small plane cut through blue sky. A tiny banner waved: <strong>“The Sunshine State.”</strong> And in looped handwriting, like a secret message: <strong>Wish you were here.</strong></p>

    <p>I flipped it over. No stamp. No return address. Just a single line:</p>

    <p><strong>“Dear Juno, Come visit. I have a surprise for you. —Florida.”</strong></p>

    <p>I laughed out loud. Who gets a postcard from a <em>state</em>?</p>

    <p>That night, I pinned it above my desk. But around midnight, something shifted.</p>

    <p>The air warmed. The corners of the postcard curled slightly, like paper touched by sunlight. Then, it shimmered—subtle at first, then unmistakable, like moonlight glancing off water. The sun in the corner... winked. I swear it.</p>

    <p>And then the postcard grew.</p>

    <p>It stretched taller, wider—expanding into something not quite paper, not quite door, but somewhere in between. The colors deepened, glowing with a light that didn’t belong in my bedroom. When I reached out, the surface rippled like water, warm as a summer breeze.</p>

    <p>A small sign floated on its surface: <strong>“Next stop: The Sunshine State.”</strong></p>

    <p>I stepped through.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>I landed barefoot on warm sand so soft it sighed. Above me stretched an endless sky the color of forget-me-nots. The air smelled of salt and citrus, and something else—something like laughter.</p>

    <p>A flamingo in aviator sunglasses strutted toward me.</p>

    <p>“Juno!” he called. “Welcome. Florida’s been waiting.”</p>

    <p>I blinked. “Who—are you?”</p>

    <p>“Finn,” he said, giving a small bow. “Official guide to sunshine and spectacle. Hop on.”</p>

    <p>A surfboard in the shape of an orange peel floated toward us, hovering inches above the beach. I climbed on, and we shot off—faster than a rollercoaster, smoother than a breeze.</p>

    <p>We flew through a rainbow mist and zipped across landscapes that shifted like dreams. Below us: a swamp palace made of driftwood and glass bottles, guarded by alligators in pearls. A coral reef that pulsed like a living kaleidoscope. A forest where the trees were made of cotton candy and wind chimes whispered secrets in languages only the breeze could carry.</p>

    <p>“Florida,” Finn said, “is more than a place. She’s a feeling.”</p>

    <p>We landed in Key West, where chickens ran wild and scooters hummed like bees. A manatee in a sunhat waved at me from a hammock. I sipped coconut juice from a mug shaped like a pirate ship while a parrot recited Shakespeare.</p>

    <p>And then came the turning point—the part that felt different. Deeper.</p>

    <p>Finn led me to the center of an orange grove. The trees grew in a perfect spiral, winding toward a towering orange tree at the center. Its trunk shimmered like amber, and from its branches hung golden fruit that pulsed with soft light.</p>

    <p>At the base of the tree was a door.</p>

    <p>No handle. Just an inscription: <strong>“Only the True Sunshine Guest May Enter.”</strong></p>

    <p>Finn looked at me. “You brought the postcard?”</p>

    <p>I nodded. It was still warm in my pocket.</p>

    <p>When I pressed it against the door, the wood softened and opened with a sigh.</p>

    <p>Inside was a world made of light.</p>

    <p>Sunlight and seawater wove through the air like threads. Clouds floated like cushions over sugar-white dunes. Flamingos danced with dolphins in shallow waves that reflected the stars. Music drifted from hidden places—steel drums, cicadas, the hush of waves.</p>

    <p>And at the center of it all stood Florida herself.</p>

    <p>She was tall and barefoot, with a cape of beach towels and a crown of mangrove branches. Her hair was a storm cloud streaked with lightning, and her eyes held hurricanes and sunsets.</p>

    <p>“Juno,” she said, “you came.”</p>

    <p>“I... think so?” My voice wavered. “Is this real?”</p>

    <p>“As real as sunlight on skin,” she said, smiling. “You believed. That’s all I needed.”</p>

    <p>She walked forward and placed something small in my hand—a marble-sized sun, glowing soft and warm, like it held a memory.</p>

    <p>“This is for you,” she said. “A piece of me. When you need light, when you need warmth, it will find you.”</p>

    <p>The light grew bright, impossibly bright. I blinked—</p>

    <p>—and I was back.</p>

    <p>Back in my room. The postcard pinned to the wall again, looking still. Ordinary. But I knew better.</p>

    <p>Because in my pocket, the little sun still glowed.</p>

    <p>And if I tilt the card just right, the sun in the corner <em>still</em> winks.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Sometimes I wonder—did I dream it? But then I smell oranges on a cold day, or hear laughter in the wind, or see a flamingo-shaped cloud overhead.</p>

    <p>And I remember.</p>

    <p>Florida isn’t just a place. It’s a living, breathing world—full of music, mystery, and a magic that finds you when you need it most.</p>

    <p>So if one day you find a postcard with no stamp, and the sun looks like it’s smiling at you—don’t throw it away.</p>

    <p><strong>Step through.</strong></p>
