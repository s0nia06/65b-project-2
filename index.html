          We often treat young people as incapable of creative, introspective thought. 
          It is important for children to access spaces where they can cultivate their 
          artistic passion alongside peers and independent of censorship. The Scribble Society 
          is a forum where young creatives can publish their work and view works made by peers 
          who share the same passions. Submissions are posted in a monthly online zine, with a 
          custom collage linking to each student's creation.
