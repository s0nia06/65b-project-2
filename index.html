            We often treat young people as incapable of deep, introspective thought. 
            But instead of completely and weighing them down with an expectation of greatness,
            it is important for children to access spaces where they can cultivate their 
            artistic passion alongside peers and independent of censorship. The Scribble Society 
            is a forum where young creatives can publish their work and view works made by peers 
            who share the same passions. Submissions are posted in a monthly zine.
